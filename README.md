Disaster Management based on CPU scheduling 

A disaster has many factors like 
1. time to take disaster back in control
2. rate of deaths per day
3. finance required per day

which will aid us in calculating the priority for each disaster, and then use priority scheduling to decide which disaster are to addressed and when. According to this we will also be calculating the waiting time just as in Priority CPU Scheduling.
